Introduction to GitHub Action

Project description: This second DevOps project will introduce you to an important notion in DevOps: automation.
You will learn how to use a recent and handy tool that allows you to automate everyday developer tasks.
You will define a set of tasks to automate, such as compiling and testing your program, and watch them being automatically executed.
In the end, you will have a useful set of automated actions that you will be able to use in all your other projects, to help you ensure that the quality of your code is always up to your standards. And that is even more super cool.
